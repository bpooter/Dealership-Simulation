DESCRIPTION-

  This is an app written in C++ that simulates a dealership. The dealership has a sales and service department and uses a abstract base class of car to differentiate between sales and service.
  Sales can place cars on sale and mark them down. Service can see where in the shop the car is. The app demonstrates error handling and inheritance. The app also will not let a car be put on sale if it is already marked as on sale. The app uses pointers along with offset notation as well as being able to sort the cars on the sales lot by their price.
